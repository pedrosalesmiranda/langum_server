------------------------------ 1 -------------------------------
logic of packs being processed by server
is it good? VS processed by client
less requests more processing
packages are returned with data to be used by client similar to TD api
------------------------------ 2 -----------------------------------
evalution size? easy test just 4 expressions vs hard test 20 expressions
test after 5 minutes a bit cheating
check what expressions were tested track pack.. but pack can have changes then we loose track
or save all evaluations as packs
THIS IS KIND OF SOLVED in --- 3 ---
------------------------------ 3 -------------------------------
evaluation should have:
evalType: listen, speak, read, write
type: pack, test, review .... etc
