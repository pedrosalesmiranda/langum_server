check database integrity meaning should have at leasts 2 expressions (base/target)
list packs should also filter out is some problem like this and log
------------------------------------
script to generate everything from pack_meanings giving prompts to put on chatgpt and outputs creates all jsons and runs all functions
to generate everything via console
--------------------------------------
no phonetic no id bug cant change id
not packtitle language no expressions
- move flask server and routes to other files
"""
TODO
- initialize database conn cursor modulo scope not init all the time
- can be class
"""
------------------------------ 1 -------------------------------
logic of packs being processed by server
is it good? VS processed by client
less requests more processing
packages are returned with data to be used by client similar to TD api
------------------------------ 2 -----------------------------------
evalution size? easy test just 4 expressions vs hard test 20 expressions
test after 5 minutes a bit cheating
check what expressions were tested track pack.. but pack can have changes then we loose track
or save all evaluations as packs
THIS IS KIND OF SOLVED in --- 3 ---
------------------------------ 3 -------------------------------
evaluation should have:
evalType: listen, speak, read, write
type: pack, test, review .... etc
--------------------------------------------
TODO endpoint to get the last 3 evaluations of each expression
in future can be just of test or something like that
